Memory Hog is a test Android application to try to allocate large
amounts of memory. This forces activities in the back stack to be
terminated, so you can check that they properly handle
onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState calls.

NOTE THIS APP COULD BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS. Have a running “adb logcat”
display so you can watch the system log on your device. Start with a
small allocation (e.g. 20MiB), and try doubling it until you see
“Process <package-name> (pid nnn) has died” and “Low Memory: No more
background processes” messages. This would be a good point to stop. Go
further, and you can kill every UI process, including the launcher. Of
course, in my testing, everything automatically restarted as necessary
without obvious ill effects, but be warned.
