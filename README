Memory Hog is a test Android application to try to allocate as much
memory as possible. This forces activities in the back stack to be
terminated, so you can check that they properly handle onSaveInstanceState
and onRestoreInstanceState calls.

NOTE THIS APP COULD BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS. In testing, it killed every
UI process, including the launcher. Of course, everything automatically
restarted as necessary without obvious ill effects, but be warned.
